# Antenna-networks
How to optimize the layout of antennas within complex telecommunication networks: a brief study. This repo contains the single-file python script I used to support this study, along with some documentation.

This work was done for the entrance exams of engineering schools (TIPE). The script mainly produces figures that I used during the presentation of my work.

<strong>Note: This script was only made to illustrate physics studies. The emphasis was not on the code itself. The quality of the script is mediocre from a software engineering standpoint, as I lacked computer science and programming skills at the time (I was majoring in Mathematics and Physics).
The purpose of this repo is rather to showcase the main points of my study, and how I used this script I made to support it.</strong>
